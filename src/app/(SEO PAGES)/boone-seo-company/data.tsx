One of the biggest challenges for us was that we were not getting any Google traffic; now we're showing up on the first page for our target keywords. The reports that they send are super easy to digest, and I can even see how the adjustments are positively affecting our sales. It's nice to know that they really do care about results."`,

The team at Biztalbox did not just take a shot in the dark at keywords, they explained what they were doing and why every step of the way. Within a few months, our website traffic nearly doubled, and we've seen a steady rise in inquiries from local customers. I recommend them to anyone serious about growth."`,
